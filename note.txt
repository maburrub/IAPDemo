Here is how to verify this test case:
1. launch the app
2. buy a product (consumable)
3. the code returns pending
4. kill the app
5. relaunch the app
6. You gonna get prompted for a password for ever as long as you keep relaunching
   because the process purchase function is called but it is still returning pending
   unless you uninstall the app and reinstall another one that calls complete instead
   of pending.
7. Before the fix, after relaunch the app never call process purchase
